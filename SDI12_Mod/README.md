Arduino-SDI-12
==============

Arduino library for SDI-12 communications to a wide variety of environmental sensors.

This library provides a general software solution, without requiring any additional hardware, to implement the SDI-12 communication protocol between an Arduino-based data logger and SDI12-enabled sensors.

SDI-12 is an asynchronous, ASCII, serial communications protocol that was developed for intelligent sensory instruments that typically monitor environmental data (http://www.sdi-12.org/).  Advantages of this are the ability to use a single available data channel for many sensors (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDI-12).

This project is part of a vision to create an open source hardware and software stack to deliver near real time environmental data from wireless sensor networks, such as those developed by the Stroud Water Research Center (SWRC) for the Christina River Basin Critical Zone Observatory (CRB-CZO).
